## Projects List
**1. Applied Statistic **
   - It Covers Descriptive Statistics, Probability & Conditional Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Probability Distributions, Types of distribution and Binomial, Poisson & Normal distribution.
      - **Project 1:** [Statistics for Decision Making](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/ccbfad029d11e7a5044d111f1ca1628bfbde75b1/01-Statistics-for-Decision-Making/StatisticalMethods-for-DecisionMaking.ipynb)
         - This project used Desriptive Statistics, Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to generate insights to make valuable decisions for the Austo Motor Company.
      - **Project 2:** [Advanced Statistics for Decision Making](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/ccbfad029d11e7a5044d111f1ca1628bfbde75b1/01-Statistics-for-Decision-Making/Advanced-Statistics-for-Decision-Making.ipynb)
         - For this project we framed an analytical problems and tested the understanding using Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA to generate insights and make valuable decisions.


**2. Data Mining: Principal Component Analysis and Clustering**
   - It covers Principal Component Analysis - PCA as the dimensionality reduction technique. It also covers Clustering - K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering - for Data Segmentation. 
      - **Project 1:** [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/ccbfad029d11e7a5044d111f1ca1628bfbde75b1/02-DataMining/PCAIndiaDataCensus.ipynb)
         - This project used India Census Data to identify important features for performing Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to generate insights. It also identified Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in data. We could reduce the number of variables from 60 to 6 by maintaining the variances in the dataset. 
      - **Project 2:** [Clustering](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/ccbfad029d11e7a5044d111f1ca1628bfbde75b1/02-DataMining/ClusteringCleanAdsData.ipynb)
         - For this project, we were provided with Advertisement data by the Digital Marketing Company. The objective was to group the adds to homogenous groups(segments) and analyze the important features CPC(Cost per Click), CPM (Cost per Thousand), CTC(Click Through Rate) across the segments.
