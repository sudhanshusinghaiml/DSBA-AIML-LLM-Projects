## Projects List
**1. Statistical Learning**
   - It Covers Descriptive Statistics, Probability & Conditional Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Probability Distributions, Types of distribution and Binomial, Poisson & Normal distribution.
      - **Project 1:** [Statistics for Decision Making](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/tree/develop/DataScienceBusinessAnalytics-Projects/01-Statistics-for-Decision-Making/StatisticalMethods-for-DecisionMaking.ipynb)
         - This project used Desriptive Statistics, Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to generate insights to make valuable decisions for the Austo Motor Company.
      - **Project 2:** [Advanced Statistics for Decision Making](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/tree/develop/DataScienceBusinessAnalytics-Projects/01-Statistics-for-Decision-Making/Advanced-Statistics-for-Decision-Making.ipynb)
         - For this project we framed an analytical problems and tested the understanding using Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA to generate insights and make valuable decisions.


**2. Data Mining: Principal Component Analysis and Clustering**
   - It covers Principal Component Analysis - PCA as the dimensionality reduction technique. It also covers Clustering - K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering - for Data Segmentation.
