## Projects List

**1. Applied Statistic**
   - Topics Covered: Descriptive Statistics, Probability & Conditional Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Inferential Statistics, Probability Distributions, Types of distribution and Binomial, Poisson & Normal distribution.
      - **Project 1:** [Statistics for Decision Making](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/develop/01-Statistics-for-Decision-Making/StatisticalMethods-for-DecisionMaking.ipynb)
         - This project used Desriptive Statistics, Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to generate insights to make valuable decisions for the Austo Motor Company.
      - **Project 2:** [Advanced Statistics for Decision Making](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/develop/01-Statistics-for-Decision-Making/Advanced-Statistics-for-Decision-Making.ipynb)
         - For this project we framed an analytical problems and tested the understanding using Hypothesis Testing and ANOVA to generate insights and make valuable decisions.


**2. Data Mining: Principal Component Analysis and Clustering**
   - Topics Covered: Principal Component Analysis - PCA, Clustering - K-means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. 
      - **Project 1:** [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/develop/02-DataMining/PCAIndiaDataCensus.ipynb)
         - This project used India Census Data to identify important features for performing Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to generate insights. It also identified Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in data. We could reduce the number of variables from 60 to 6 by maintaining the variances in the dataset. 
      - **Project 2:** [Clustering](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/develop/02-DataMining/ClusteringCleanAdsData.ipynb)
         - For this project, we were provided with Advertisement data by the Digital Marketing Company. The objective was to group the adds to homogenous groups(segments) and analyze the important features CPC(Cost per Click), CPM (Cost per Thousand), CTC(Click Through Rate) across the segments. 


**3. Predictive Modelling:**
   - Topics Covered: Multiple Variable Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Logistic Regression, Linear DiscriminantAnalysis and Decision Trees
      - **Project 1:** [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/develop/03-PredictiveModelling/LinearRegression-CompactivData.ipynb)
         - This project used comp-activ databases(a collection of a computer systems activity measures). The objective was to build a model to predict 'usr'(Portion of time (%) that cpus run in user mode) and to find out how each attribute affects the system to be in 'usr' mode.
      - **Project 2:** [Clustering](https://github.com/sudhanshusinghaiml/DSBA-AIML-LLM-Projects/blob/develop/03-PredictiveModelling/ClassificationModels-ContraceptiveSurvey.ipynb)
         - The project used data of 1473 females collected from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey by the Republic of Indonesia Ministry of Health. The objective was to predict do/don't they use a contraceptive method of choice based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics.
